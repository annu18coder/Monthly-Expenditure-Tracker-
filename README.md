# Monthly-Expenditure-Tracker
Worried about your montly budget calculation, analysis and its maintainance. I have build a montly budget tracker for tracking your montly expenditure. I have created this program using C.
A simple C-based Monthly Expense Tracker in C records daily expenses, generates text-based bar graphs, stores reports in a file, and highlights budget status( Under Budget,  Exact Budget,  Over Budget).
I have tried using Unicode emojis but I got partial success, but that's all okay atleast I could use the emojis in the .txt file.

how to run it?

bash
gcc exptrc.c -o exptrc
./exptrc
